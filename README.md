## Automatic Attendance System
This is an automatic attendance system that utilizes facial recognition technology to scan and log the attendance of authorized users. The system captures and analyzes the faces of individuals, compares them against a pre-existing database of authorized users, and records the time of their attendance in a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file.

Features:-
Facial Recognition: The system uses advanced facial recognition algorithms to accurately identify individuals based on their facial features.
Authorized User Database: A pre-defined database of authorized users is used as a reference for comparison during the attendance scanning process.
Real-time Attendance Logging: The system logs the attendance of authorized users in real-time, capturing the time of their arrival.
CSV File Export: Attendance records are stored in a CSV file format, allowing for easy data management and further analysis.
